# Stochastic Process Library for Python (stpy)

## Installation
First clone the repository:

`git clone git@gitlab.inf.ethz.ch:mmutny/sensepy.git`

Inside the project directory, run

`pip install -e .`

The `-e` option installs the package in "editable" mode, where pip links to your local copy of the repository, instead of copying the files to the your site-packages directory. That way, a simple `git pull` will update the package.

The project requires Python 3.6+, and the dependencies should be installed with the package (let me know if it doesn't work for you).
